         Welcome to my website! I am aspiring software developer. I am currently learning my skills at Base Camp Coding Academy- Graduate Institute in Water Valley, MS. 
         I currently am the Office/ IT Manager at Internal Medicine and Pediatric Clinic in Saltillo, MS. Encryption and Two Factor Authentication are my specialty as I enjoy
         front-end and back-end development. My aspirations include making HIPAA compliant apps and webpages for private owned Doctor Offices. The IT field is also an interest 
         due to the hobby of always trying to improve and maintain at any workplace I have worked for past and present. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        I'm a native of Saltillo, MS and a graduate of The University of Mississippi where I received my Bachelors in Business Administration with a minor in Accounting.    </p>
